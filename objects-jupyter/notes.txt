"Objects are Python's abstraction for data."

An Object in Python is a:
	* identity, which is the int returned by id()
	* a type, which is an object whose type is `type`, and
	* a value

Some objects are immutable (strings, tuples, frozensets),
some are mutable (lists, dicts, sets).

	* Note: Some immutable objects (like tuples)
	        can reference mutable data.
	        So while the _identities_ of the objects it
	        references will never change, the _values_
	        of those objects may.
